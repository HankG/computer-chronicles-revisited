      <description>In Part 1, I explained my decision to go with Hover for domain registation and Linode for the virtual private server (VPS) I use for this blog. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly review the process of setting up the VPS and getting it to work with my domain.
Obviously, I relied principally on documentation prepared by others. Specifically, I used how-tos published by both Linode and one of its competitors, Digital Ocean. I actually find the Digital Ocean documentation a bit easier to read and follow.</description>

      <description>In developing my new blog, I opted to build a static website using Hugo and other open source software tools, as opposed to using an all-in-one commercial service like Squarespace or WordPress. There are certain advantages to this DIY approach, as well as drawbacks. So in this series of posts, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through my thought process in deciding to use Hugo and explain the steps I took in building this blog &amp;ldquo;from scratch.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I purchased an iPad. This is my first Apple device in awhile, so I decided to check and see if my Apple ID still worked. It did, albeit after going through the process of resetting my long-forgotten password.
To my slight surprise, this was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d used my Apple ID since 2012. That was the year I moved away from OS X to Linux as my everyday operating system.</description>
